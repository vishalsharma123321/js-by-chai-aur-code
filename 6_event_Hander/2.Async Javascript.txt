# JavaScript 
    *synchronous  = means not multi threaded language works one by one execution
    *single threaded = moves on next task or line after finsihing the first one

#Execution Context 
    * execute one line of code at a time 
    * call stack * memory heap
    $coment$ = each operation waits for the last one to compelet brfore execution 

# Blocking code            V/S    Non Blocking Code 
  *Blocks the flow of Program        *Does not block execution            
  *Read file sync                    *Read file Async
$Coment$= use case of blocking code ,  lets assume a user is doing registration the the website 
          and you are using Non blocking code then while the users data is checked the database
          the Non blocking wil show the next line of code which is succesfully registred 
          so thats why we use the Blocking code which will firt check the data base till 
          the execution is stoped and after the execution of the checking is succesfully from the 
          database it will show registration succesfully.
