/*
Binding this: The bind(this) ensures that when handleClick is called as an event handler, this inside 
handleClick refers to the instance of the React class, not the button element.


The bind method in JavaScript is used to create a new function that, when called, has its this keyword 
set to the provided value. This is especially useful in cases where you want to ensure that the this 
keyword within a function refers to the object it was originally bound to, regardless of how or where 
the function is invoked.

In your code, bind is used to ensure that the this keyword inside the handleClick method refers to 
the instance of the React class. Without bind, this inside handleClick would be undefined or refer 
to the button element when the click event handler is called.
